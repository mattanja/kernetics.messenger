messenger
=========

messenger is intended to be a lightweight replacement for good old GNU mailman.
(At the moment it is only a test project for NancyFX and Service Stack hosted on Linux/Mono.)

The following issues will be addressed:
* Simple setup, simple configuration and independent from the underlying mailing system
* Receiving mail from members of a list will forward mail to all members of the list
* Web API for list management and sending mail

Out of scope (for the time being):
* Mail archive
* Spam filtering (list of accepted remote servers though, so spam filtering can be done on regular mail server)
